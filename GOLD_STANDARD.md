# The gold standard, and the plan to reach it

Started 2026-11-11. The founder's bar: every screen, the experience as a customer meets it, and the
codebase itself each score **9.5 or more, with no exceptions**. This file is the standard, the plan
and the running scorecard. `REDESIGN_PLAN.md` and `INBOX_PLAN.md` hold the history that led here.

Limits that stay in force: nothing is pushed, merged to `main`, submitted, or written to the live
Supabase database or App Store Connect. Money goes through `Core/Money`; dates and reminders follow
`ENGINEERING_RULES.md`; no dark patterns.

## 1. How anything is scored

- 0 to 10, **never rounded up**. A score needs evidence that can be pointed at: a capture that was
  opened and read, a test that can fail, a number a script printed. "Not seen" is not a score.
- A thing's score is the mean of its dimensions, **capped at its weakest dimension plus 0.5**.
  So 9.5 needs every dimension at 9.0 or more.
- What the numbers mean: **9.5** a design-award jury or a senior reviewer finds nothing to fix in
  five minutes, and a first-time user does the job without stopping to think. **9.0** one small flaw
  a professional would notice. **8** flaws an ordinary user notices. **7** it works but looks or
  reads unfinished. Below that it is not shippable.
- If something cannot reach 9.5 for a reason outside the code (an approval that hasn't come, a
  device that isn't here), it is listed as such with its true score. It is never rated up.

## 2. The standard for a screen (eight dimensions)

| Dimension | 9.5 means |
|---|---|
| Purpose | One job, understood in three seconds; one main action. |
| Truth and need | Every sentence and number has a source; nothing could be removed without loss (`pausely-design`, "Truth and need"). |
| Hierarchy | The eye lands on the one thing that matters, then the action; nothing competes. |
| Identity | Unmistakably Ink and Paper: ink ground, paper only where money is decided or proven, mint only for money kept, serif for the question or number, mono for proof. |
| Craft | Spacing on the scale, edges aligned, type consistent, every state designed (empty, loading, error, full). |
| Accessibility | VoiceOver reads it as sentences; works at the largest text size without clipping; targets 44 pt; contrast AA; passes the system accessibility audit. |
| Reach | Correct in Arabic (right to left) and the four other languages; correct on iPad. |
| Feel | Responds at once; motion and haptics only where they mean something; honours Reduce Motion. |

Evidence a screen needs before it is called done: opened and read in English, Arabic, the largest
text size and iPad, in every state it has; the system accessibility audit passes on it.

## 3. The standard as a customer (role-played, in rounds)

Six people, each walked through the real app from captures of the real flows:

1. **The searcher**: found it searching "subscription tracker", has nine subscriptions, pays for nothing yet.
2. **The sceptic**: was burned by an app that sold data; reads every privacy sentence; decides whether to connect email.
3. **The Arabic speaker**: phone in Arabic, pays in riyals.
4. **The low-vision user**: largest text size, VoiceOver for some steps.
5. **The returner**: thirty days in; a reminder arrives; keeps one, cancels one, looks at what was saved.
6. **The buyer**: at the paywall, deciding whether $29.99 a year is worth it.

Each rates seven things: the first 90 seconds, trust, effort, clarity of what it does for me, would
I pay, would I come back, would I tell someone. Every persona's journey must reach 9.5. A round is:
walk, write down every hesitation and doubt, fix them, walk again. At least three rounds.

## 4. The standard for the codebase (ten dimensions)

| Dimension | 9.5 means | How it is measured |
|---|---|---|
| Truth | No data or copy the app cannot stand behind (invented prices, plans, scores, steps). | Truth audit ledger at zero; claims tests. |
| No dead code | No unused declaration, file, asset, string key, entitlement or document. | `scripts/gold_check.sh` dead-code and clutter checks. |
| Correctness | The engineering rules hold everywhere; no known bug. | Guard tests; engineering audit ledger at zero. |
| Tests | Every piece of logic has a test that can fail; nothing skipped on every run; all green three runs in a row, serially. | Test run output. |
| Translation | Every string a person can see exists in all five languages. | A guard test over every literal, not only `L10n.string`. |
| Accessibility | Every screen passes the system audit. | The screen tour runs the audit. |
| Privacy and security | No secret in the repository; every privacy sentence held by a test; no entitlement the app doesn't use. | `InboxPrivacyTests`, secret scan, entitlement check. |
| Naming and consistency | Names say what things are; one pattern per job. No "Revolutionary", "Luxury", "Genius". | Hype-name check. |
| Size and simplicity | No file is large without a reason; data files hold only what is used. | Line counts in the scorecard. |
| Repository | The root holds what a newcomer needs and nothing else; every document is current. | Clutter check. |

## 5. The plan

Each phase ends in commits, a green test run, and an updated scorecard (section 7). Every finding
from the scan goes into the ledger (section 6) and is closed there, so nothing is fixed from memory.

**Phase 0. Scan (read-only).** Four independent audits (dead code, truth, design rules on every
view, engineering) plus mechanical scans. Output: the ledger.

**Phase 1. Gates before fixes.** Write the checks that turn the standard into something a script
prints, and let them fail: `scripts/gold_check.sh` (old UI, dead code, clutter, hype names, design
lint), a translation guard over every literal, the accessibility audit inside the screen tour, a
launch argument for every screen and state so each can be captured.

**Phase 2. Purge.** Dead code and files, stale documents, leftover folders and scripts, unused
assets and string keys, unused entitlements, hype names. Largest first.

**Phase 3. Truth.** Catalog and service data cut down to what is true and used; engine text,
notifications, widgets and shortcuts translated and checked; the claims people rely on (paywall,
privacy, help) each tied to a test.

**Phase 4. Engineering.** Every bug and rule break from the audit, bugs first, each with a test.

**Phase 5. Screens.** Every screen and state through the four-variant tour and the audit; rebuild
or repair until each reaches 9.5; scores recorded only from what was seen.

**Phase 6. Customer rounds.** The six personas, three rounds or more, fixes between rounds.

**Phase 7. The store page (local files only).** Listing text and screenshots brought into line
with the app as built; pushing them is the owner's step.

**Phase 8. Proof.** Everything green three serial runs in a row; Debug and Release build; the final
scorecard; what is left for the owner.

## 6. The ledger

Findings from the scan, with status. Filled in when the audits report (Phase 0), closed as work lands.

## 7. Scorecard

| Area | Score | Evidence | What holds it down |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screens | not yet scored against this standard | | |
| Customer rounds | not yet run | | |
| Codebase | not yet scored | | |
